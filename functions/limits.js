// follow.

// --- Bandwidth ---------------------------------------------------------
//
// A cost guard, not a product. It caps how much a single account can write in
// a day so a runaway client or a script cannot run up the bill; it is not what
// anyone is sold, and it is deliberately far above normal use.

// --- Stored bytes ------------------------------------------------------
//
// This one *is* the product. It is what a person understands ("5 GB"), what a
// price is attached to, and what actually costs money to keep, because
// attachments live in Cloud Storage for as long as the note does. Bandwidth
// above is charged per day and forgotten; this accumulates.
//
// Free is set where a text note-taker will never reach it and someone using
// image and music blocks in earnest will, within weeks — those are the two
// groups, and only the second one costs anything to serve.

};

// `legacy` exists because a limit introduced after people are already using
// something is a limit taken away from them. Accounts that predate the free
// tier keep room to spare rather than waking up over a line that did not exist
// when they filled it; new accounts get `free`. It is assigned per account, as
// data, so who is on it can be read rather than inferred.
//
// `owner` is the project's own account. Deliberately a plan and not a rule
// about the shape of a uid: matching a prefix would hand unlimited storage to
// whichever stranger's account happened to start with the same two characters,
// and "who pays nothing" is not a question to answer with a substring.

// An account with no plan recorded is free, and so is one carrying a plan name

// silently promote everyone by failing open.

// enormous number instead would store a lie that looks like a real limit to
// whoever reads it next.
