/**

 * maths, the same clamps, the same division by the canvas scale. The copies had
 * already drifted apart in spelling — `{ ...size }` against `width: size.width`,
 * two indentations, a blank line here and there — which is the harmless kind of
 * drift, and exactly the kind that hides the other sort. Nothing in a copy
 * announces that it was meant to match four others.
 *
 * The maths lives here, in a module Node can import, so it can be checked
 * without a browser, a canvas or a block. The listening and the redrawing stay
 * at the call site, where they need a DOM.
