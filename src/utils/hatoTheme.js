// Two themes over four colours. Each pairs one of them as the sky the crowd
// stands against with a second as the accent, and keeps the other two in
// supporting roles, so purple, pink, orange and pale blue all appear in both.
//
// Dusk runs dark chrome, Day runs light — the wallpapers are a night sky and
// a daylight one, and matching the chrome to each is what keeps the two from
// reading as one theme in two hues.
//
// `chrome` carries the surfaces, because they are the half that flips between
// the two; deriving them from a single lightness flag made both harder to
// read than writing them out. Panels are translucent so the colour underneath
// carries through. The canvas deliberately is not: a translucent surface
// stacked on a translucent surround comes out darker than the surround and
// splits the canvas into two visible sheets. Blocks keep the heavy black
// outline and flat offset shadow the drawing itself uses, since nothing in
// this artwork is soft-edged.
