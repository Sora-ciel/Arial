/**
 * "Recolor this folder's blocks to match the theme", decided in one place.
 *
 * The switch has two moments and only one of them is a repaint of everything:
 *
 *   - the theme's colours move, or the switch is turned on — repaint every
 *     block, because that is what the switch is for;
 *   - the blocks change — folder opened, block added — paint the ones that are
 *     not already wearing this theme, and leave a hand-picked colour alone.
 *
 * Telling those two apart is the whole problem, and it has been got wrong in
 * both directions:
 *
 * First it was a single reactive line naming `blocks`, so it re-ran on the
 * user's own colour change and put the theme's colour straight back. The colour
 * picker did nothing for as long as the switch was on.
 *
 * Then the fix keyed the repaint on the theme alone — which meant opening a
 * folder repainted nothing, because the theme had not moved. Those blocks were
 * painted under whatever theme was current when they were last saved, so they
 * came back wearing *another theme's* colours: not the theme chosen, and not a
 * colour anybody picked.
 *
 * What was missing both times is a record of which colours the theme gave a
 * block. `_baseBgColor` stores what the block looked like *before* painting, so
 * the switch can be turned off again; it says nothing about what was painted
 * on. `_themedBgColor` is that missing half. With it the question needs no
 * timing at all, and answers itself from the block:
 *
 *   wearing paint that is not this theme's  → the theme's to repaint
 *   wearing something else                  → the user's, leave it
 *   never painted                           → paint it
 *
 * Which is why this survives a folder change, a reload and a sync: it is a
 * property of the block, not a memory of what has happened this session.
