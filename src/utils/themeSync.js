 * by whichever device was not present for it, assume "deleted" and a theme
 * made on a plane disappears on landing. `syncedAt` is what separates them: it
 * is set once a theme has been written to the cloud, and is never synced
 * itself, so it means precisely "this device has seen this theme in the
 * cloud". Absent from the cloud *and* previously synced is a deletion.
