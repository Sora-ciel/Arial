// block on the canvas remounts it, and every mode switch tears the whole tree
// down. An editor's own history goes with it, so after either of those Ctrl+Z
// did nothing at all — the text looked the same but its past was gone.
//
// Holding the history here instead means it belongs to the block rather than
// to whichever editor happens to be showing it, so writing stays undoable
// after a move, after switching modes and back, and for as long as the app is
// open.
//
// This is deliberately the *only* history for text. The workspace has its own,
// for adding, moving and deleting blocks; letting both answer the same
// keystroke is what previously made one Ctrl+Z undo two different things and
// cost a page of writing.

// step and one Ctrl+Z erases the lot. But breaking at every word is the
// opposite mistake — it took twenty-nine presses to walk back three sentences,
// where any other editor takes a handful. Notepad steps back a whole typing
// run; ProseMirror's own history groups on a half-second pause and nothing
// else. A sentence is the unit that sits between those, so a step is closed by
